Beneath the silver sun.
It's dark and life's begun.
Thousands strong, Feel as one.
Lights in sensuround.
Move me, throw me down.
Ten feet tall.
Beyond all walls.

You're a dream and my world is spinning.
Round and round out of all control tonight.
And I see all the people moving.
Dancing through the corridors of light.
And I feel so alive.
I feel so alive.

Alice in wonderland.
Reaches out her hand.
Lasers beam, For you and me.
Through the great divide.
Our two worlds collide.
We fall in love again.

You're a dream and my world is spinning.
Round and round out of all control tonight.
And I see all the people moving.
Dancing through the corridors of light.
And I feel so alive.
I feel so alive.
Oh-oh so alive.

You're a dream and my world is spinning. (spinning, spinning)
You're a dream and my world is spinning.
Round and round out of all control tonight.
And I see all the people moving.
Dancing through the corridors of light.
And I feel so alive.
I feel so alive.
I feel so alive.
I feel so alive.
I feel so alive.
Oh oh... so alive.
