Oh girl, oh girl...

Hold your body close to mine
Leave behind all of the worries on your mind
I can see it in your eyes
We've been waiting for this moment to arrive

And you make me feel
Feel so shine and new
Like I'll never be blue again
And all magic feelings never fades
I want to spend the rest of my days. with you

Love me in that special way
Let your lips say what no words can ever say
Lets not waste another day
Lock the door and then we'll throw the key away

And you make me feel
Feel so shine and new
Like I'll never be blue again
And all magic moment feel so right
I want to spend the rest of my life. with you

Oh girl, only you make me feel brand new
Oh girl, you make me feel brand new...
