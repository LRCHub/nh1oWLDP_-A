I don't know who you are
It's almost like we're strangers
I've had enough of you
You treated me like a fool
I don't know who you are
I should have seen the dangers
I can't get over you
You treated me like you do
There's been some changes
There's been some changes
I don't know who you are
It's almost like we're strangers
I've had for you
You treated me like a fool
I don't know who you are
I should have seen the dangers
I can't get over you
You treated me like you do
There's been some changes
There's been some changes
There's been some changes
There's been some changes
It's almost like we're strangers
It's almost like we're strangers
Aliens in different spaces
There's been some changes
There's been some
There's been some
There's been some
There's been some changes
It's almost like we're strangers
It's almost like we're strangers
(There's been some changes)
Aliens in different places
There's been some changes
It's almost like we're strangers
It's almost like we're strangers
