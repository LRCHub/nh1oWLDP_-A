Look in trees
Through the window at the moor
Like some
You play with my cheek, yeah
Whisper somewhere I was born
Liquid light harmony
Wrapped around inside of me
Born out of trees
On a moonlit song
It's free
Shiny and warm
Shiny and warm
Head in a storm
I'm driving home to you
Shiny and warm
Shiny and warm
Licking the tar
I'm almost there for you
Wind down the window
And feel a rush of air around my face
Breathe in light
Wet and warm
Feel the outside coming in
Look at the trees in the dark
Bending like a bony finger
Gravel flicks on a metal moon
Wild and free
Shiny and warm
Shiny and warm
Head in a storm
I'm driving home to you
Shiny and warm
Shiny and warm
Licking the tar
I'm almost there for you
Light licks the trees
Feel the rush
Cold air wrap around my head
You play with my cheek yeah
Whisper something nearly dawn
Shiny and warm, head in a storm
Licking tar, I'm driving home to you
Coming around, coming around
Coming around, I'm driving home to you
Coming around, coming around
Coming around, I'm almost there for you
